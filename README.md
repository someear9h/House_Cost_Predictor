# House_Cost_Predictor
This project leverages linear regression to make predictions based on [a specific dataset, e.g., customer data, house prices, or insurance expenses]. It preprocesses the data using various techniques, including handling missing values, scaling numeric features, and one-hot encoding categorical variables.

Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Missing values imputed, numeric columns scaled, and categorical columns one-hot encoded for consistent and robust predictions.
Modeling Approach: A linear regression model was trained and evaluated, with a focus on optimizing performance and understanding feature impacts.
Evaluation Metrics: Model performance assessed using metrics like RMSE to quantify prediction accuracy.
Getting Started
Installation: Clone the repo and install dependencies.
Run the Model: Use the predict_input() function for single input predictions, applying all preprocessing steps in real-time.
Usage
Ideal for data science and machine learning projects involving structured data, this project provides a foundation for understanding and applying linear regression to predictive modeling tasks.
